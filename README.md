# JavaScript Starter Kit
Quick start kit for the following stack:
* Node.js
* Express
* Postgres
* Sequelize
* Next.js
* React
* Redux
* Webpack

Next.js provides server-side rendering for React.

It includes webpack configuration (through Next.js) and Babel (stage-0 by default).

It will soon include a full user authentication system.

## Getting started
* Clone the repo
* install node 6 (probably with nvm)
* install yarn
* run `yarn`
* copy config/default.example.js to default.js and config.example.json to config.json and edit as needed
* sequelize db:migrate
